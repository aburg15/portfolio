# My Personal Portfolio Site

## Description

My portfolio site was built using React.  I was in the process of learning React at the time and wanted to build my portfolio site to help reinforce the React concepts we were covering in class.  The site is hosted on GitHub pages while the domain name was purchased via Google domains.
