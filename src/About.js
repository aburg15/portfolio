      <p className="about-me-text">I am a front end software developer and former CPA with six years of experience in public accounting.  
        I recently decided to switch careers and pursue my passion for software development. I specialize in JavaScript and React. I also have experience working with HTML, CSS, Git and other front end development tools.  
        I am looking to further develop my skills as a junior developer by joining a team where I will be able to learn and provide value. If you think I would be a good fit for your company, please reach out!</p>
